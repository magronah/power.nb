\title{Simulate Log Means for OTUs}
\usage{
logmean_sim_fun(logmean_param, notu)
}
\arguments{
\item{logmean_param}{A list containing the parameters for the distribution:
\itemize{
\item \code{mu}: A single value or a vector of mean(s) for the normal or mixture distribution.
\item \code{sigma}: The standard deviation(s) for the normal or mixture distribution.
\item \code{lambda}: (Optional) A vector of weights for the components of the mixture distribution. Required only if \code{mu} has more than one value.
}}

\item{notu}{An integer specifying the number of OTUs to simulate.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of simulated log means for the specified number of OTUs.
}
\description{
This function generates log means for a specified number of OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) based on the provided parameters.
If a single mean is specified, the log means are drawn from a normal distribution.
If multiple means and corresponding weights are specified, the log means are drawn from a mixture of normal distributions.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Single normal distribution
params_single <- list(mu = 0, sigma = 1)
logmean_sim_fun(logmean_param = params_single, notu = 100)

# Example 2: Mixture of normal distributions
params_mixture <- list(
  mu = c(-1, 1),
  sigma = c(0.5, 0.5),
  lambda = c(0.4, 0.6)
)
logmean_sim_fun(logmean_param = params_mixture, notu = 100)
